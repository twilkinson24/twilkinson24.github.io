                    1. Description of the Fundraise Genius Platform
               </h4>
               <p>Fundraise Genius provides a fundraising software platform (the “<span class="bold">Platform</span>”)
                    that allows participants to effectively manage their fundraising campaign (the “<span
                         class="bold">Campaign</span>”), harness email and SMS communication for outreach, collect
                    donations, and process fundraiser sales for their school, team, event, activity or organization (the
                    “<span class="bold">Beneficiary</span>”). The Platform is accessed via the Fundraise Genius website
                    located at https://www.fundraisegenius.com.

                    2. Requirements and Standards; Acceptance by Fundraise Genius
               </h4>
               <p>
                    Access to the Platform is predicated upon your ability to meet – and continuing to meet – all of the
                    requirements and standards delineated in this Agreement, and your acceptance of all of the Terms and
                    Conditions of this Agreement. – Please note that Fundraise Genius reserves the option to review any
                    request to access the Platform and participate in a Campaign, and to deny any request for access,
                    for any reason. If you are a participant in a Campaign subsequent to your acceptance of this
                    Agreement – unless we have denied your request for access, you will receive an account code that
                    will provide backend access to the Platform.
               </p>
               <p>
                    You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself (and any team
                    members for whom you might submit information) during the registration process. If you provide any
                    information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete (or becomes untrue, inaccurate,
                    not current or incomplete) – or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is
                    untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete – we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your
                    account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Platform (or any portion thereof). You
                    are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your information. You agree to accept
                    responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately
                    by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@fundraisegenius.com">support@fundraisegenius.com</a> of
                    any unauthorized use of your account or any other
                    breach of security.

                    Participant hereby acknowledges and agrees that access to the Platform – and use of the Platform in
                    conjunction with any Campaign or any webpages created on behalf of a Beneficiary – does not
                    constitute a solicitation of donations by Fundraise Genius; Fundraise Genius does not engage in any
                    solicitation activities on behalf of you, or any Beneficiary with which you may be involved.

                    is solely available to answer questions related to the functionality and features of the Platform.

                    into contracts as such as this one due to age, you must abide by such age limits and you must not
                    use the Website if you are not permitted to do so by such local jurisdiction.

               </h4>
               <p>
                    Fundraise Genius has engaged the services of Stripe, a 3rd party payment service provider, to
                    process all credit card donation/payment transactions and to manage the routing of applicable
                    customer information through the credit card and electronic check processing networks. We are not
                    affiliated with the payment processor other than to provide the service of payment processing.
                    Accordingly, Fundraise Genius expressly disclaims responsibility and liability for all services
                    provided by our processor, including those related to donation/payment transactions, and you hereby
                    agree that Fundraise Genius shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as
                    a result of your use of such service. Fundraise Genius offers two methods of fund disbursement. 1) A
                    check sent by mail or, 2) direct deposit via ACH into your Organizations designated bank account. By
                    initiating a fundraising campaign on Fundraise Genius and by your acceptance this Agreement, you
                    additionally agree to Stripe’s Terms of Use – https://stripe.com/us/legal – in order for your
                    Beneficiary Organization to receive payments. Furthermore you agree to provide Stripe certain
                    information related to your Campaign and Organization. By default, disbursement will be made via
                    check. Within 7 business days from the end date of the Campaign, a check will be issued and sent to
                    the beneficiary at the mailing address provided or delivered by a Fundraise Genius representative
                    less Fundraise Genius’s Applicable Service Fees. Please note that any such bank account designated
                    to receive the funds must be in your Beneficiary’s name.
